  Abstract                 = {<span class='snippet'>In</span> this paper, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the <span class='snippet'>power</span> <span class='snippet'>consumption</span> <span class='snippet'>in</span> the switching fabric <span class='snippet'>of</span> a bufferless shared-per-wavelength (SPW) optical packet switch architecture <span class='snippet'>in</span> which one bank <span class='snippet'>of</span> wavelength converters (WC) is dedicated to each wavelength. We assume that both optical gates and WCs are realized <span class='snippet'>in</span> semiconductor optical amplifier technology. <span class='snippet'>In</span> our <span class='snippet'>evaluation</span>, we account for the <span class='snippet'>power</span> <span class='snippet'>consumption</span> <span class='snippet'>of</span> the current drivers needed to both controlling the used active devices and supplying the thermoelectric coolers. SPW allows for a complexity reduction <span class='snippet'>of</span> the spatial switching matrix that leads to reduced <span class='snippet'>power</span> <span class='snippet'>consumption</span> with respect to other switching architectures. Results show the effectiveness <span class='snippet'>in</span> terms <span class='snippet'>of</span> consumed <span class='snippet'>power</span> <span class='snippet'>of</span> the considered architecture with respect to the shared-per-node reference architecture, where a fully sharing strategy <span class='snippet'>of</span> WCs is adopted. The main results show that SPW allows us to reduce the <span class='snippet'>power</span> <span class='snippet'>consumption</span> <span class='snippet'>in</span> the order <span class='snippet'>of</span> 26% for offered traffic equal to 0.6. The obtained results also show how the fabric switching <span class='snippet'>of</span> the SPW optical packet switch consumes much less <span class='snippet'>power</span> per gigabits per second carried than the one <span class='snippet'>of</span> a typical commercial core router.},

Higheravailability often comes with a higher cost. We describe several steps requiredfor estimating the costs of realistic network scenarios. Capital expenditures(CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) are classified. An activity-basedapproach is used to quantify the cost of the event-driven operational processessuch as repair and service provisioning. We discuss activity duration andavailability parameters as required input data, which are necessary for calculatingthe processes' costs for realistic network scenarios. The relevant availabilitymeasures for an IP-over-Optical network are described using a triplet representationwith optimistic, nominal, and conservative values. The model is applied toa reference German network scenario.},
