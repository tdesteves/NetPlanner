The total CAPEX of a network, as it was already described in \ref{Capex}, is the sum between two differentiated costs. Firstly, the link cost depends on the link length, which has integrated components such as OLTs, transceivers and amplifiers and the node cost depends on the traffic intensity by each node. The optical node cost is 0 because all the ports in the network are electrical.

In order to get the results for the heuristic approach, routing and grooming algorithms are used which try to obtain the most near optimal solution for the six cases detailed in this chapter. Then, it will be applied a cost report with all the detailed information about the costs of the network. The final CAPEX depends on the transport mode (opaque, transparent and translucent), possibility of the network having a dedicated 1+1 protection scheme or not and the network traffic (low - 0.5 Tbit/s, medium - 5 Tbit/s and high - 10 Tbit/s).

To calculate the total network cost it has to be considered the links cost and the nodes cost. The CAPEX value of a network is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_heuristic}.

\begin{equation}
C_C = C_L + C_N
\label{Capex_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Where {$C_L$ is the link cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$C_N$ is the node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\end{itemize}

On the first hand, the link cost, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_Link_heuristic}. If the length of the link is longer, the resulting costs will be higher due to of the necessity of having more components which carry all the traffic from all origin nodes to all destination nodes.

\begin{equation}
C_L = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N L_{ij} \left( 2 \gamma_0^{OLT} + 2 \gamma_1^{OLT} \tau W_{ij} + N^R_{ij} c^R \right)
\label{Capex_Link_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Where {$i$ is the index for start node of a physical link}.
\item Where {$j$ is the index for end node of a physical link}.
\item Where {$N$ is the total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}.
\item Where {$L_{ij}$ is the binary variable indicating if link between the nodes $i$ and $j$ is used, $L_{ij} \in {0, 1}$}.
\item Where {$\gamma_0^{OLT}$ is the OLT cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$\gamma_1^{OLT}$ is the transponder cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$\tau$ is the line bit-rate}.
\item Where {$W_{ij}$ is the number of optical channels in link $i$ $j$}.
\item Where {$N^R_{ij}$ is the number of optical amplifiers in link $i$ $j$}.
\item Where {$c^R$ is the optical amplifiers cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\end{itemize}

The line bit-rate that is used in this report has the value of 100. It represents the separation between regeneration stages in km.

On the other hand, the nodes cost, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_Node_heuristic}.

\begin{equation}
C_N = C_{EXC} + C_{OXC}
\label{Capex_Node_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Where {$C_{EXC}$ is the electrical node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$C_{OXC}$ is the optical node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{11pt}
As all the nodes have an electrical part and an optical part, so it is necessary to calculate both with their respective formulas and sum the results.

The electrical node cost, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is given by the equation \ref{Capex_Node_EXC_heuristic}.

\begin{equation}
C_{EXC} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} N_{exc,n} \left( \gamma_{e0} + \sum_{c=-1}^B \gamma_{e1,c} P_{exc,c,n} \right)
\label{Capex_Node_EXC_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Where {$N$ is the total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}.
\item Where {$N_{exc,n}$ is the binary variable indicating if node $n$ is used, $N_{exc,n} \in {0, 1}$}.
\item Where {$\gamma_{e0}$ is the EXC cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$\gamma_{e1,c}$ is the EXC port cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars) with bit-rate $B$ and with a given transceiver reach}.
\item Where {$P_{exc,c,n}$ is the number of ports of the electrical switch}.
\item Where {$B$ is a natural number corresponding to the maximum index of short-reach ports, see table below}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  Index & Bit rate \\
 \hline\hline
  -1 & 100 Gbits/s line bit-rate (long-reach port) \\
  0 & 1.25 Gbits/s tributary bit-rate (short-reach port) \\
  1 & 2.5 Gbits/s tributary bit-rate (short-reach port) \\
  2 & 10 Gbits/s tributary bit-rate (short-reach port) \\
  3 & 40 Gbits/s tributary bit-rate (short-reach port) \\
  4 & 100 Gbits/s tributary bit-rate (short-reach port) \\

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The constitution of the electrical node part can be seen in the Integer Linear Programming section \ref{exc_design}.

Finally, the optical cost, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is given by equation \ref{Capex_Node_OXC_heuristic}.

\begin{equation}
C_{OXC} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} N_{oxc,n} \left( \gamma_{o0} + \gamma_{o1} P_{oxc,n} \right)
\label{Capex_Node_OXC_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Where {$N$ is the total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}.
\item Where {$N_{oxc,n}$ is the binary variable indicating if node $n$ is used, $N_{oxc,n} \in {0, 1}$}.
\item Where {$\gamma_{o0}$ is the OXC cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}.
\item Where {$\gamma_{o1}$ is the OXC port cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars) }.
\item Where {$P_{oxc,n}$ is the number of ports of the optical switch}.
\end{itemize}

The constitution of the optical node part can be seen in the Integer Linear Programming section \ref{oxc_design}.

After all the formulas needed to calculate the CAPEX of a network are demonstrated above, it is also essential to have pre-defined the costs of the network equipments. In the table \ref{table_cost_heuristic} it is shown the cost, in euros, of all the equipments with their symbols used in the respective formulas.\\
