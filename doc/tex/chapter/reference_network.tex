\chapter{Reference Network Specification}

The purpose of this chapter is to describe a reference network that will be used for the various types of dimensioning throughout this project. In addition to the reference network will also be described the various traffic models used in this network in question.\\
The organization of this chapter is done by creating two sub-chapters, the first to describe the physical topology of the network and a second to create the traffic matrix for the three existing traffic models (low, medium and high traffic).\\
