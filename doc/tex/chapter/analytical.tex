\chapter{Analytical Models}

The focus of the current section is to propose and describe a model for the analytical calculation of the network CAPEX, based on the three modes of transport (opaque, transparent and translucent) without survivability and protection.\\
In the section \ref{analytical_CAPEX}, it is described how the CAPEX is calculated in a general way. In the following subsections it is proposed in detail the restrictions of the three previously mentioned models without survivability and with protection as well as a detailed report of the results obtained for each case.
